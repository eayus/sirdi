Problem:

    Currently we're not rebuilding when the user makes changes to the config file.

    Easy example:

        Build project with a config file without the "main" field.

        Now add "main" field.

        Run project.

        Get internal error since an executable was never generated when the project was built.



We are not checking the reuslt of "system" commands for failure, so if building fails for example, then
we still try and run the non-existent executable.



Idris2 Bugs:

    Calling a dependency "local-1", and sticking it in the "depends" folder means Idris doesn't detect it..


    If the "depends" folder contains a symlink to the dependency, Idris does not seem to find the dependency.
    To test this, try changing the "cp -r" to "ln -s" in "Sirdi.Core.Build".


    Mistyping an Idris CLI argument still tries to contiunue anyway. E.g. typing "idris2 --instal" will open the
    REPL, since the "--install" flag is mistyped.


Come up with more asccurate type for URLs and commit hashes

Maybe have a type for 'Hash ident' rather than just ad-hoc strings..
